        /// of a brand new MobileServiceClient will just get the HTTP response
        /// for the corresponding request.  Here's an example of a Handle
        /// implementation that will automatically retry a request that times
        /// out.
        ///     var response = await next.Handle(request).AsTask();
        ///     if (response.StatusCode == 408) // Request timeout

        ///     }
        ///     return response;
        /// Note that because these operations are asynchronous, this sample
        /// filter could end up actually making two HTTP requests before
        /// returning a response to the developer without the developer writing
        /// any special code to handle the situation.

        /// Filters are composed just like standard function composition.  If

        /// .WithFilter(F3), it's conceptually equivalent to saying:
